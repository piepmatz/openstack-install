# The host files are used to resolve computer names such as "controller" to the ips.
# We chose not to use a dns server and a dhcp server because it was easier.
# However this can be changed in the future.
# If you add a dhcp and dns server and wonder why the host is not resolved to the right ip address, 
# adjust or remove this script.
